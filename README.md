# Handwritten_3_and_5_classification
We use logistic regression for classifying handwritten digits '3' and '5'. Project completed as part of homework 5 of CSE 250A of UCSD, CSE, Fall 2022.

# Tasks: 
For a detailed description of the model and tasks in this project, please refer to the file 'Problem and sample sol.pdf'. Briefly : 
1. Part a is about formulating how to train the model and training the model by gradient ascent. Convergence is shown in the form of plots of log-likelihood, percentage error rates w.r.t iterations, and giving the final weight vector.
2. Part b is about using the trained model in part a to label the images in the test files. 

# Files :
1. hw5_test3.txt: test data for digit '3'. 
2. hw5_test5.txt: test data for digit '5'.
3. hw5_train3.txt: train data for digit '3'.
4. hw5_train5.txt: train data for digit '5'.  
5. Problem and sample sol.pdf: The detailed problem statement with each part/task is indicated and we also give a sample solution of the tasks stated. 
6. code.ipynb: The code to solve the problem parts as given in 'Problem Statement.pdf'.

# Execution :
Execute code.ipynb notebook according to parts given in 'Problem Statement.pdf'. You may have to run the previous part's code before going to the next part.
